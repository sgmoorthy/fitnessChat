The double poling movement involves not just arms and \nshoulders, but also core and legs; classic ski technique (alternating \narms) is also possible.\nThe SkiErg easily accommodates adaptive athletes and those with \nlower body injuries, as one can sit or kneel and still get a great \nupper body and core workout.

Two hot and the one ground \nwires must be independently isolated (not \nlooped or tied to other circuits).\nElectrical Applications\n » \nDo not modify the plug provided with this product. If it will not fit your electrical outlet, have a proper outlet installed by a  \nqualified electrician.\n » \nElectrical supply may fluctuate in your area. To ensure stable performance if the product we require the following wiring gauges  \nbased on the distance between the single treadmill and the panel: 100’ = 10 Gauge, 150’ = 8 Gauge, 200’ = 6 Gauge.\nWhen designing a facility or installing new Freemotion equipment into a facility, it is important to have the correct electrical power \nprovisions in order for the equipment to operate safely and properly. Each treadmill must be furnished with an Individual Branch \nCircuit. Circuits for 100-Volt models must include a 20-amp circuit breaker and individual 20-amp isolated ground receptacles for \neach treadmill. Circuits for 220-Volt must include a 15-amp circuit breaker and individual 15-amp isolated ground receptacles for \neach treadmill. The NEC requires that each outlet have dedicated conductors of at least 12 AWG for line, neutral and ground for \n20-amp service. Larger conductors (10 AWG) may be required for long branch circuits or high temperatures to prevent voltage drop. \nDedicated outlets must not share line, neutral or ground conductors with other outlets. This means that a single breaker, one hot wire, \none neutral wire, and one ground wire are connected from the panel to a single electrical load, in this case, 1 treadmill.\nALL CIRCUITS FOR TREADMILLS SHOULD NOT SHARE A NEUTRAL GROUND. Each neutral wire and each ground wire should be \ntied back to the panel directly. This should help to avoid 3 problems commonly experienced:\n » \nOverloading the Circuit Breaker – With only one treadmill connected to a single circuit breaker in the electrical panel, the \nsmaller circuit breaker in the treadmill will trip first if there is an over-current situation due to abnormal treadmill operation. If \nmore than one treadmill is wired to the same panel breaker, the additional current requirements may frequently overload and trip \nthe panel breaker, even though the treadmills are operating normally.\n » \nOverloading the Neutral Wire – If there are multiple treadmills connected to the same neutral wire, even if each hot conductor \nis wired to separate breakers, there is a risk of overloading the neutral wire, possibly resulting in a dangerous situation (could \noverheat and cause a fire) and/or more commonly, low voltage at the outlet. As a result of the low voltage the amperage (AMPS) \ngoes up to keep up with the current demand. With the high amounts of current comes high heat, which will damage the electrical \ncomponents such as the power board, console, and other small components within the treadmill.\n » \nLow Voltage at the Outlet – A few things can cause this; the most common is too many treadmills on one circuit (or neutral wire), \nwhich overloads the wire, heating it up, and causes the voltage at the outlet to drop. This can also happen if the wires are not a large \nenough size, or if the distance from the panel to the outlet is too far. Low voltage at the outlet can only be measured when the load \nis at its peak. The voltage may be fine when all the treads are off, but lower significantly when they are all on and drawing 20-amps. \nLow voltage causes problems for the drive motor, power board, and the motor controller, and can result in unexpected behaviors of \nthe treadmill.\n » \nThe benefits of an Isolated Ground (IG) – The primary reason for the use of an IG is to provide a noise-free (electromagnetic \ninterference) ground return, separate from the equipment grounding return. The IG provides an isolated separate ground \npath for the ground reference in the treadmill. The IG also helps eliminate the potential for a ”ground loop”, which can cause \nelectromagnetic interference.\n110-Volt Treadmill Applications\nFreemotion treadmills require an individual \nbranch circuit using a NEMA 5-20R Isolated \nGround Receptacle. The hot, neutral, and \nground wires must each be independently \nisolated (not looped or tied to other circuits).\nELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS NOTICE\nPOWER PROVISION\nTREADMILL\n\n1616\n  CARDIO: HIGH-USAGE - 22, 10, & 8 SERIESUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings), Drive Motor7 Years7 Years\n  Parts and Console2 Years2 Years\n  Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  CARDIO: LOW-USAGE - 22, 10, & 8 SERIES**US & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings), Drive Motor7 Years7 Years\n  Parts and Console3 Years3 Years\n  Labor3 Years1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  TV ATTACHMENTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  MYE Digital LCD TV3 Years3 Years\n  MYE TV Controller & Wireless Receiver2 Years2 Years\n  MYE Wireless Transmitter5 Years5 Years\n  INDOOR BIKESUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)7 Years7 Years\n  Belt5 Years5 Years\n  Parts and Console2 Years2 Years\n  Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\nFUSIONUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)10 Years10 Years\n  Parts2 Years2 Years\n  Ropes and Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  STRENGTH/BENCHES/RIGS/RACKS/ATTACHMENTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)10 Years10 Years\n  Parts3 Years3 Years\n  Cables and Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  Upholstery & Padding120 Days120 Days\n  FREE WEIGHTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Urethane-coated Weights (repair or replace at our discretion)3 Years3 Years\n  Rubber-coated Weights \n(repair or replace at our discretion)2 Years2 Years\nWARRANTIES\n *Includes Non-warning Decals, Deck Rails, Pulse Grips, USB, Audio Jack, Handrails, Motor Hood, Fan Levers, Water Bottle Holders, Pedals, Pedal Straps,  \nSeats, Handles/Levers/Knobs, Hand Grips, Removable Trays, Weight Pins, Springs, Belts (except Walking Belts), Accessories, Rust on Any Metal Components. \n **For non-dues paying facilities with machine usage of 6 hours or less per day.\n                            \n\n17\nphone  +1 877-363-8449   ||  email sales@freemotionfitness.com  ||  website freemotionfitness.com\n© 2020 Freemotion Fitness, Inc.

Two hot and the one ground \nwires must be independently isolated (not \nlooped or tied to other circuits).\nElectrical Applications\n » \nDo not modify the plug provided with this product. If it will not fit your electrical outlet, have a proper outlet installed by a  \nqualified electrician.\n » \nElectrical supply may fluctuate in your area. To ensure stable performance if the product we require the following wiring gauges  \nbased on the distance between the single treadmill and the panel: 100’ = 10 Gauge, 150’ = 8 Gauge, 200’ = 6 Gauge.\nWhen designing a facility or installing new Freemotion equipment into a facility, it is important to have the correct electrical power \nprovisions in order for the equipment to operate safely and properly. Each treadmill must be furnished with an Individual Branch \nCircuit. Circuits for 100-Volt models must include a 20-amp circuit breaker and individual 20-amp isolated ground receptacles for \neach treadmill. Circuits for 220-Volt must include a 15-amp circuit breaker and individual 15-amp isolated ground receptacles for \neach treadmill. The NEC requires that each outlet have dedicated conductors of at least 12 AWG for line, neutral and ground for \n20-amp service. Larger conductors (10 AWG) may be required for long branch circuits or high temperatures to prevent voltage drop. \nDedicated outlets must not share line, neutral or ground conductors with other outlets. This means that a single breaker, one hot wire, \none neutral wire, and one ground wire are connected from the panel to a single electrical load, in this case, 1 treadmill.\nALL CIRCUITS FOR TREADMILLS SHOULD NOT SHARE A NEUTRAL GROUND. Each neutral wire and each ground wire should be \ntied back to the panel directly. This should help to avoid 3 problems commonly experienced:\n » \nOverloading the Circuit Breaker – With only one treadmill connected to a single circuit breaker in the electrical panel, the \nsmaller circuit breaker in the treadmill will trip first if there is an over-current situation due to abnormal treadmill operation. If \nmore than one treadmill is wired to the same panel breaker, the additional current requirements may frequently overload and trip \nthe panel breaker, even though the treadmills are operating normally.\n » \nOverloading the Neutral Wire – If there are multiple treadmills connected to the same neutral wire, even if each hot conductor \nis wired to separate breakers, there is a risk of overloading the neutral wire, possibly resulting in a dangerous situation (could \noverheat and cause a fire) and/or more commonly, low voltage at the outlet. As a result of the low voltage the amperage (AMPS) \ngoes up to keep up with the current demand. With the high amounts of current comes high heat, which will damage the electrical \ncomponents such as the power board, console, and other small components within the treadmill.\n » \nLow Voltage at the Outlet – A few things can cause this; the most common is too many treadmills on one circuit (or neutral wire), \nwhich overloads the wire, heating it up, and causes the voltage at the outlet to drop. This can also happen if the wires are not a large \nenough size, or if the distance from the panel to the outlet is too far. Low voltage at the outlet can only be measured when the load \nis at its peak. The voltage may be fine when all the treads are off, but lower significantly when they are all on and drawing 20-amps. \nLow voltage causes problems for the drive motor, power board, and the motor controller, and can result in unexpected behaviors of \nthe treadmill.\n » \nThe benefits of an Isolated Ground (IG) – The primary reason for the use of an IG is to provide a noise-free (electromagnetic \ninterference) ground return, separate from the equipment grounding return. The IG provides an isolated separate ground \npath for the ground reference in the treadmill. The IG also helps eliminate the potential for a ”ground loop”, which can cause \nelectromagnetic interference.\n110-Volt Treadmill Applications\nFreemotion treadmills require an individual \nbranch circuit using a NEMA 5-20R Isolated \nGround Receptacle. The hot, neutral, and \nground wires must each be independently \nisolated (not looped or tied to other circuits).\nELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS NOTICE\nPOWER PROVISION\nTREADMILL\n\n14\n  CARDIO: HIGH-USAGE - 22, 10, & 8 SERIESUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings), Drive Motor7 Years7 Years\n  Parts and Console2 Years2 Years\n  Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  CARDIO: LOW-USAGE - 22, 10, & 8 SERIES**US & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings), Drive Motor7 Years7 Years\n  Parts and Console3 Years3 Years\n  Labor3 Years1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  TV ATTACHMENTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  MYE Digital LCD TV3 Years3 Years\n  MYE TV Controller & Wireless Receiver2 Years2 Years\n  MYE Wireless Transmitter5 Years5 Years\n  INDOOR BIKESUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)7 Years7 Years\n  Belt5 Years5 Years\n  Parts and Console2 Years2 Years\n  Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\nFUSIONUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)10 Years10 Years\n  Parts2 Years2 Years\n  Ropes and Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  STRENGTH/BENCHES/RIGS/RACKS/ATTACHMENTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Frame (not including coatings)10 Years10 Years\n  Parts3 Years3 Years\n  Cables and Labor1 Year1 Year\n  Cosmetic & Wear Items*6 Months6 Months\n  Upholstery & Padding120 Days120 Days\n  FREE WEIGHTSUS & CANADAINTERNATIONAL\n  Urethane-coated Weights (repair or replace at our discretion)3 Years3 Years\n  Rubber-coated Weights \n(repair or replace at our discretion)2 Years2 Years\nWARRANTIES\n *Includes Non-warning Decals, Deck Rails, Pulse Grips, USB, Audio Jack, Handrails, Motor Hood, Fan Levers, Water Bottle Holders, Pedals, Pedal Straps,  \nSeats, Handles/Levers/Knobs, Hand Grips, Removable Trays, Weight Pins, Springs, Belts (except Walking Belts), Accessories, Rust on Any Metal Components. \n **For non-dues paying facilities with machine usage of 6 hours or less per day.\n                            \n14\n\n15\nphone  +1 877-363-8449   ||  email sales@freemotionfitness.com  ||  website freemotionfitness.com\n© 2020 Freemotion Fitness, Inc.

This exercise motion mimics the more natural, comfortable, and \nfunctional movements of free weight training. Additionally, the rocking movement \nconstantly shifts the user’s center of gravity to impose small, yet appropriate \nchallenges to the core musculature, while maintaining adequate stability.\nThe ROC-IT line represents a training technology optimally suited to meet the \ntraining needs of diverse population groups ranging from the de-conditioned and \nsedentary to the more athletic and well conditioned.\n\nCMJ | PAGE 3 RS | PAGE 3\nTHE INNOVATIVE BIOMECHANICAL DESIGN OF THE ROC-IT\n®\n LINE DELIVERS\nA MORE NATURAL, UNRESTRICTED, FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT.\nTraditional machine based exercises are not considered functional by virtue of their inability to mimic activities of daily life. \nTheir rigid, fixed designs impose limitations to joint movement that necessitate continuous adjustments by the joints to follow \nthe unnatural movements of the machine. This increases the potential for injury.\nThe ROC-IT  line embodies a unique training experience that achieves the unrestricted joint movement and core activating\nbenefits of functional training coupled with the stabilizing benefits of machine-based equipment.\nCOMFORT\n Ô\nReduced Noise— Silent Steel\n®\n weight stacks are \nspecifically designed for noise reduction during exercise\n Ô\nHead Support & Oversized Handles— Provides a more \ncomfortable and secure workout\nCONVENIENCE\n Ô\nIntegrated Towel/Bottle Holder and Accessory Tray— \nKeep personal items organized and reduce clutter on the \ngym floor\n Ô\nRatcheting Adjuster System— Quick and easy seat \nadjustments to accommodate varying user sizes\n Ô\nEasy Step Through Design— Speeds up workouts and \nallows for user to quickly enter/exit the machine\n Ô\nIntegrated Scuff Guards & Rubber Foot Protectors— \nProtects the machine’s frame finish and facility floor \nSLEEK AND APPEALING\n Ô\nMolded Plastic Upholstery Covers & Contoured Foot \nRests — Adds a contemporary and finished look\n Ô\nEnclosed Weight Stacks— Offers privacy to the user \nwhile exercising\nEDUCATION\n Ô\nROC-IT Training Manual*— Developed in conjunction \nwith American Council on Exercise (ACE\n®\n).

    "content": "\n\n\n\nTHE HOIST\n®\n YOUTH FITNESS LINE WAS DESIGNED WITH \nTHREE MAJOR PRINCIPLES OF CHILDREN’S FITNESS IN MIND — \nSAFETY, FUN AND RESULTS!\nSAFE T Y: Equipment suited for adults is not appropriate for the \ndeveloping body of a child. Designed specifically for kids, our KL line \nfocuses on multi-joint movements to effectively spread the pressure \nacross more than just one isolated joint. KL’s neutral hand grips \neliminate shoulder rotation, reducing the chance of injury to \ndeveloping muscles, joints, therefore reducing additional \ntension on the body and bones. \nFUN: Kids will want to work out because \nit’s FUN! The dynamic movement (ROX\n®\nTechnology) of KL targets specific muscle \ngroups and encourages children to \nexercise by simulating the motion \nof a ride. A physical activity \nthat is both fun and beneficial \nencourages a child to develop \nhealthy exercise habits. \nRESULT S: Participants can expect an \nimprovement in bone density and tendon/ligament strength. Skeletal \nmuscular strength, joint stability and endurance are also enhanced. The \nbenefits of strength training play an important role in the prevention of \ninjuries. Resistance training enhances nervous system function and promotes \nemotional health, and can provide improvements in \nself-esteem and confidence.\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, children as young as 7 or 8 can participate in, and \nbenefit from, strength training exercise. Young adults do not add muscular \npower the same way adults do. Rather, performing strength training exercises \nare important to promote heathy bone density, increase neuromuscular \ndevelopment, promote healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, protect muscles \nand joints from sports-related injuries and to teach healthy lifestyle habits.\n[KL] YOUTH FITNESS LINE\nALL KL CIRCUITS INCLUDE AN EXERCISE TRAINING PROGRAM \nDEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EXERCISE®.\n\n Allows children to experience the sensation of completing a dip\n Dynamic linkage movement system\n Safety shield and weight stack with exercise placards\n[KL] SEATED DIP\nK L-2101\nLength:   77.25\" / 196.25 cm\nWidth:     27.50\" / 70.00 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  473 lbs. / 215 kg\nL 77.25\" (196.25 cm)\nW 27.50\" (70.00 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Replicates movement of a pull up\n Adjustable seat and bar positions\n Counter-balanced exercise arm\n[KL] CHIN-DIP\nK L-2201\nLength:   65.25\" / 165.75 cm\nWidth:     33.00\" / 84.00 cm\nHeight:    77.00\" / 195.5 cm\nMachine Weight:  563 lbs. / 256 kg\nL 65.25\" (165.75 cm)\nW 33.00\" (84.00 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Mimics the ride sensation of rowing\n Adjustable chest pad to accommodate varying arm lengths\n Self-aligning linear ball bearings\n[KL] MID ROW\nK L-2203\nLength:   81.50\" / 207 cm\nWidth:     27.50\" / 70.00 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  491 lbs. / 223.25 kg\nL 81.50\" (207 cm)\nW 27.50\" (70.00 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Flexibility of several body resistance exercises in an adjustable unit\n Decline/Flat /Incline exercise angles\n Four upholstered roller pads for stabilization\n[KL] ABDOMINAL BENCH\nK L-2261\nLength:   67.25\" / 171 cm\nWidth:     28.00\" / 71.25 cm\nHeight:    34.00\" / 86.5 cm\nMachine Weight:  110 lbs. / 50 kg\nL 67.25\" (171 cm)\nW 28\" (71.25 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Emulates a smooth riding motion without shoulder impingement\n Adjustable back pad to accommodate children of varying sizes and \narm lengths \n Induction hardened steel shafting\n[KL] CHEST PRESS\nKL-2301\nLength:   76.50\" / 194.5 cm\nWidth:     27.50\" / 70.00 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  493 lbs. / 224 kg\nL 44.00\" (112 cm)\nW 27.50\" (70.00 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Extends with compound movement from squatting to standing positions\n Oversized foot placement pads\n Drop away seat\n[KL] SQUAT PRESS\nK L-24 03\nLength:   78.75\" / 200.00 cm\nWidth:     27.50\" / 70.00 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  482 lbs. / 219 kg\nL 78.75\" (200.00 cm)\nW 27.50\" (70.00cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Imitates the sensation of a ride in an adjustable unit\n Adjustable back pad to  accommodate children of varying sizes and \narm lengths\n Oversized foot placement pads\n[KL] LEG PRESS\nK L-2410\nLength:   76.75\" / 199.5 cm\nWidth:     28.00\" / 71.25 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  510 lbs. / 231.5 kg\nL 76.75” (195 cm)\nW 28.00” (71.25 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Provides a rocking motion and compound movement; minimizes any \nimpingement of the shoulder\n Adjustable seat pad to  accommodate children of arying sizes\n[KL] SHOULDER PRESS\nK L-25 01\nLength:   83.25\" / 111.5 cm\nWidth:     27.50\" / 70.00 cm\nHeight:    58.50\" / 148.75 cm\nMachine Weight:  530 lbs. / 241 kg\nL 83.25\" (111.5 cm)\nW 28.00\" (71.25 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\n Allows children with excess upper body weight to complete the \nextension by simply raising their legs\n Foot mount pedestals for ease of access and use\n[KL] BACK/HIP EXTENSION\nKL-2662\nLength:   28.00\" / 71.25 cm\nWidth:     17.50\" / 45.50 cm\nHeight:    25.25\" / 64.25 cm\nMachine Weight:  119 lbs. / 54 kg\nL 28.00\" (71.25 cm)\nW 25.25\" (64.25 cm)\nProduct Specifications:\nUS/METRIC\n\nHOIST warranties this product to the original  \npurchaser only and guarantees this product to be free \n from defects in workmanship and/or materials under  \nnormal use or service.

Our products can be found in living rooms, gyms, physiotherapy practices, company gyms, hotels, spas, resorts and by \npersonal trainers. \nWe’ve developed a new line of strength equipment intended for home use in the past years. The assortment of fitness accessories \nhas been expanded as a result of the increasing popularity of fitness at home. A popular product category is functional training. We \nwant to meet the increasing demand in the area of functional training and cross fit. This year, we are launching products that are not \nonly intended for home use, but also fot commercial use. These products are designed to be used in gyms, by physiotherapists and by \npersonal trainers. \nWe are proud of all our new yoga products. These products are designed with an eye on functionality; the yoga mats will stay firm \nbecause of an anti-slip layer. Besides yoga mats, we also provide yoga products that will offer support doing yoga poses. \nIn our headquarters in Almere we provide the right product content, like pictures, videos and texts. We can deliver very quickly \nfrom our warehouse with high stocks.
